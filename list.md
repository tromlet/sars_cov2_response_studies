I've compiled a list of studies from a myriad of sources that confirm the effectiveness of the use of masks and social distancing to combat the SARS-CoV2 pandemic. The fight against misinformation cannot solely be the effort of algorithms and corporate development houses - we've also got to be able to reach those who are convinced by it.

Feel free to use these in any online debates, try to remain civil (I KNOW), and if you're here and interested in participating and learning in good faith, feel free to read the links below and ask any questions. Science is accessible, science is testable. Bullshit on the internet isn't. Skepticism is good, but a willingness to change one's mind in the face of new information includes being willing to change one's mind on previously-held skepticism.

This study compares infection rates between states that issued mask orders earlier with states that delayed on theirs.

This study compares basically the same thing, but looks at things globally, across countries.
Evidence for Social Distancing policies:
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine, 22 June 2020
https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-evidence-to-support-the-2-metre-social-distancing-rule-to-reduce-covid-19-transmission/
Here's an analysis that concludes that a.) increasing social distance correlates to decreasing risk, and b.) distances of over two metres may well be warranted in certain situations.
The Lancet (peer-reviewed), 1 June 2020
https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)31142-9/fulltext
This is a meta-study from The Lancet (...a peer-reviewed, VERY highly-respected  scientific journal) confirming that social distancing policies of one metre significantly reduced infection, and that two metres might be more effective still - which is consistent with the analysis above from a different source altogether.
Please use at your convenience. 
EDIT: If you have further studies from other institutions (I need to add some regarding hydroxychloroquine to the list), please feel free to add them. Criticisms regarding my formatting are welcome, I may make this a markdown document shareable on Github - that way anyone can add further summaries of each study and really hit important points in them.
