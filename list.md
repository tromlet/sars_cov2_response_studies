This is a list of studies from a myriad of sources that confirm the effectiveness of the use of masks and social distancing to combat the SARS-CoV2/COVID-19 pandemic. The fight against misinformation cannot solely be the effort of algorithms and corporate development houses - we've also got to be able to reach those who are convinced by it.

Feel free to use these in any online debates, try to remain civil (I KNOW), and if you're here and interested in participating and learning in good faith, feel free to read the links below and ask any questions. Science is accessible, science is testable. Bullshit on the internet isn't. Skepticism is good, but a willingness to change one's mind in the face of new information includes being willing to change one's mind on previously-held skepticism.

## Study Notes/Summaries
1. This study compares the efficacy of a variety of face coverings (surgical masks, cloth masks, even a bandana) at blocking moisture/vapor particulates emitted by humans merely during speaking using readily-available (as opposed to extra sensitive, laboratory-grade) equipment.
2. 
3.
4.
5.
6. This study compares infection rates between states that issued mask orders earlier with states that delayed on theirs.
7. This study compares basically the same thing, but looks at things globally, across countries.
8. This is an analysis (which may contain links TO peer-reviewed works) that concludes that a.) increasing social distance correlates to decreasing risk, and b.) distances of over two metres may well be warranted in certain situations.
9. This is a meta-study from The Lancet (a peer-reviewed, VERY highly-respected scientific journal) which confirms that social distancing policies of one metre significantly reduced infection, and that two metres might be more effective still.
10.
