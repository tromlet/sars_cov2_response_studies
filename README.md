# Scientific Support for the Public Health Response and Recommended Countermeasures to the COVID-19 Crisis

This is a public repository containing a series of studies that respond specifically to arguments deployed by "anti-mask" or "covid-19 denialist" political factions with expert-designed and in most cases peer-reviewed studies.

Please use at your convenience. 

If you have further studies from other institutions (we need to add some regarding the non-efficacy hydroxychloroquine to the list), please feel free to add them. Criticisms regarding my formatting are welcome - if we can present this information in a better, more-concise way, so much the better.
